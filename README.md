# GST-Scrapper-Tool

So I was in the 1st year of my articleship and was given one excel containing a bunch of GSTIN(GST Number) and what I need to do is search it on the GSTIN portal and copy-paste the required data like whether GSTIN is active or not & whether the same is in regular or composition scheme, etc.
So I thought why not to give try to do the same with fully automative* and here I started to build a python code to do the same work. The code automatically opens the browser reads and types gstin in a provided excel and scraps the required data and stores the same in excel.
